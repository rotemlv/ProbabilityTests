# Experiment:
# We have a sack with 5 white, 3 black and 2 red eggs
# we randomly pull 2 eggs from the sack
# we want to know the probability of pulling eggs with a certain characteristics
# for example - at least one egg is red, no egg is white, etc.
# This code allows us to define a condition for the experiment,
# and to count the number of occurrences where said condition is met.
# Hence, we get an approximation for the probability of the condition to happen.
