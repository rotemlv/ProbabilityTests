# A testing file for probability testing
# We test the probabilities of a specific case in the Secretary problem:
# (described here)
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem
# given n candidates, while hiring the top k available, we count and thus estimate
# the probability of a candidate to be hired (functions end with "single_hire")
# and we also look for the Expected value for the number of hires per group of
# n candidates (functions with suffix "expected_hired_count").

# we accept k people to work for us (the best out of n)
# what is the expected value of the number of people accepted?
# let's say (for example) - do k people get accepted to work on average?
# our "educated guesses" were:
# Expected value: k * log(n / k)
# for the i-th candidate: probability to be hired = (k / (n - i + 1)) ,as long as i <= n - k
